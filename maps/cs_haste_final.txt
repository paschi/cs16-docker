Town haste - Hostage Rescue
Mapping & Textures by:

Counter-Terrorists: Terrorists, after two
successfull series of bombings in the
central town, as they fled, ended up in
the suburbs. This is the last point where
you must stop them before they escape out
of reach. Without Hostages they are
doomed, so try to evacuate them all.

Terrorists: Prevent the Counter-Terrorists
from rescuing the Hostages, eliminate
the Counter-Terrorists and escape from the
town.
