Background:
Springfield has been over-run by terrorists intent on
destroying the town's supply of Duff, so as to seriously 
demoralise the townsfolk into submitting to their
demands. (Lame isn't it?)

Terrorists:
You must bomb the Duff brewery to halt the fresh supply
of beer entering Springfield. In order to invalidate all
other Duff you must also bomb the Duff pipeline leading
to Moe's.

Counter-Terrorists:
Prevent the terrorists getting their hands on the town's
supply of the gorgeous, cold beverage.
