After a successful bombing a group of terrorists has caught 
a tube in a desperate attempt to escape the incoming
counter terrorism squad.
At the next station they halt the train and try to make their 
way to the exits before the CTs can stop them. 
Meanwhile the Counter-Terrorist forces are approaching.


Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the terrorists 
from escaping by eliminating them.

Terrorists: Escape as fast as you can or 
have a look at the armoury... :)
