For anybody who might actually read this, 
I was dissapointed with the current awp
maps so I decided to make my own with a 
little more depth. Hopefully you enjoy it.

Goodies:
=-=-=-=-
Underground tunnels - You can infiltrate
  the other teams base via a quick jaunt
  through the sewers! Yay!

Bustable shit - the boards spanning the 
  trench can be shot as well as the crates
  within the trench... bustable shit is 
  cool 'cause it breaks :)

That's it for now, I hope you enjoy :)
